# Fullstack-Web-App-MQP

This is the Full-stack Web Application created for the Midigating the Impact of Fake news MQP. 
To run this code you simply can clone the repository on your machine, and then in the main directory you should type 'npm install' to 
install the proper dependencies in the server. After that you should cd into the client folder and then again type 'npm install' to download
the dependencies for the React application client side. 

To run the application in development mode, you can go to the main diretory and type 'npm run dev'. This will use the tool concurrently to run both
the server and the client similaneously. 

Due to the fact that the application acesses mongoDB and the Twitter API, the authentication keys and mongoDB connection URL have been hidden.
If you want to have the application truly running in development, then you'll need to generate your own Twitter Aut keys and create your own
mongoDB data source. 

This repo is purely for educational purposes and the project was completed as a part of the Midigating the Impact of Fake News MQP project at
Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
